# Restaurant Page Project

This is a **Restaurant Page** project created as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) JavaScript curriculum. The project focuses on using **JavaScript modules** and **Webpack** to build a multi-page dynamic website.

## Features

- **Dynamic Page Content**: All content is rendered dynamically using JavaScript and DOM manipulation.
- **Tabbed Navigation**: 
  - Home
  - Menu
  - Contact
- Modular code organization with **JavaScript ES6 modules**.
- Styled with CSS for a visually appealing design.
- Responsive layout for seamless usability on both desktop and mobile devices.
